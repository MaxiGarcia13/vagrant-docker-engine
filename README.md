# Setting Up Your Computer

First yo make sure that you dont have docker descktop and docker cli in you computer.

If you have installed, remove it ðŸ—‘.

Then, you need install virtualbox, vagrant and docker-compose.

## On Mac OS

```
brew install virtualbox

brew install vagrant

brew install docker

brew install docker-compose
```

# Setting Up Vagrant

Inside the repo run `vagrant up` (this command read Vagrantfile and create the VM and install packages in your new VM)

##Â Test docker in your VM
Docker Engine and Docker CLI should be working inside the VM now. Let's test it.

```
vagrant ssh

docker run hello-world
```

## Customize your VM.

If you need install other packges you can add put in. (If you added new packages in Vagrantfile you need run `vagrant reload`, it mount again the VM)

```
config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
    # HERE YOU WRITE THE PACKAGES YOU WANT
SHELL
```

Maybe you need sync project that need docker, put in this line for sync it. (It should be the same route)

```
  config.vm.synced_folder "MY_LOCAL_PROJECT", "MY_PROJECT_IN_VM"
```

If you need copy files in some path of VM, you can use

```
config.vm.provision "file", source: "MY_LOCAL_FILE", destination: "MY_LOCAL_FILE_IN_VM"
```

Also you can expose ports in your VM:

```
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 9230, host: 9230
```

# Last settings

Add in your .bashrc or .zshrc

Configure Docker CLI to use the Vagrant VM

```
export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://vagrant@127.0.0.1:2222
```

Add the Vagrant ssh key to the host known keys.

```
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
```

## Test docker ðŸ˜±

run `docker run hello-world` (outside of your VM).

In case that you have an error in the output of this command, try running the command specified in the message, for example:

```
 ssh -l vagrant -p 2222 -- 127.0.0.1 docker system dial-stdio
```

## ðŸ¤¯ Suggestion

You can create the aliases in your `.zshrc` or in your `.bashrc` for turn on docker. (when turn on your machine the VM maybe is turn off, you should turn on it every day).

```
alias vagrant-add-private-key="ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key"

alias docker-start="vagrant-add-private-key && vagrant up"
alias docker-down="vagrant suspend"
```

Every day you can use `docker-start` for get up docker or `docker-down` for suspend your docker.

#Â Config your VSCode
Go to preference, search docker and in `Docker: Host` put `ssh://vagrant@127.0.0.1:2222` (the same value that you use in the variable DOCKER_HOST)

# Normal command to use vagrant

```
# Create or turn on the VM
vagrant up

# Stop vm
vagrant suspend

# Reload VM
vagrant reload

# Delete VM
vagrant destroy
```

Happy coding! ðŸ¥³
